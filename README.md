# JavaScript Data Processing Program

## Description
This JavaScript program processes data related to learners' submissions for assignments in a course. The program calculates each learner's average score and the percentage score for each assignment, considering various conditions such as due dates and late submissions. The output is formatted as an array of objects containing the learner's ID, average score, and percentage scores for each assignment.

## Requirements
The program fulfills the following requirements:

- Declare variables properly using `let` and `const` where appropriate.
- Utilize operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.
- Cache strings, numbers, and Boolean values within variables.
- Control program flow using at least two `if/else` statements and optionally one `switch` statement.
- Manage potential errors using `try/catch` statements to handle incorrectly formatted or typed data.
- Utilize at least two different types of loops.
- Use at least one loop control keyword such as `break` or `continue`.
- Create and manipulate arrays and objects to store and process data.
- Demonstrate retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.
- Use functions to handle repeated tasks, such as processing learner data.
- Output processed data as described in the assignment.
- Ensure the program runs without errors.
- Commit frequently to the git repository to track changes and progress.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the JavaScript file (`app.js`) in your preferred code editor.
3. Ensure the provided data (`CourseInfo`, `AssignmentGroup`, `LearnerSubmissions`) is correctly formatted and updated if necessary.
4. Run the program using a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js or a web browser console.
5. View the output in the console, which will display the processed learner data.

## Credits
This program was created as an assignment for the JavaScript Fundamentals course.
